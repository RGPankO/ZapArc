# Breez SDK Setup and API Requirements

## üîç **Your Observation is Correct!**

You're absolutely right - the Breez SDK likely needs proper configuration and possibly API keys. The hanging behavior suggests the SDK is trying to connect to Breez services without proper authentication.

## üîß **Current Status: Basic Wallet Mode**

I've temporarily **disabled the Breez SDK** to get basic wallet functionality working first. The updated extension now:

‚úÖ **Works without Breez SDK:**
- Creates and encrypts wallet storage
- PIN-based authentication
- Basic wallet setup and unlock
- Tip detection and QR code generation

‚ùå **Missing (requires Breez SDK):**
- Actual Lightning Network connectivity
- Real balance checking
- Sending/receiving Lightning payments
- LNURL operations

## üîë **Breez SDK API Requirements**

### **What We Need to Research:**

1. **API Key Requirements**
   - Does Breez SDK Spark require API keys?
   - How to register for Breez services?
   - Rate limits and usage restrictions?

2. **Configuration Options**
   ```typescript
   const breezConfig = {
     network: 'mainnet' | 'testnet',
     apiKey?: string,
     // Other required config?
   }
   ```

3. **Service Endpoints**
   - What Breez services does the SDK connect to?
   - Are there alternative endpoints?
   - Self-hosted options?

## üß™ **Test the Basic Wallet Now**

The extension should now work for basic functionality:

### **1. Reload Extension & Clear Storage**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Reload extension
2. Clear extension storage (important!)

### **2. Test Basic Wallet Setup**
1. **Click extension icon** ‚Üí Should show "Setup Wallet"
2. **Click "Setup Wallet"** ‚Üí Enter PIN (6+ chars)
3. **Should complete successfully** and show main interface
4. **Close and reopen** ‚Üí Should show unlock prompt
5. **Enter PIN** ‚Üí Should unlock and show wallet

### **3. Test Tip Detection**
1. **Open test.html** ‚Üí Tip prompt should appear
2. **Click "üì± Show QR"** ‚Üí Should generate QR code
3. **Payment buttons** ‚Üí Will show confirmation but fail at actual payment

## üìã **Console Logs to Expect**

**Successful basic setup should show:**
```
Starting wallet setup with PIN length: 6
Background: Starting wallet setup
WalletManager: Starting basic wallet setup (no Breez SDK)
WalletManager: Got user settings
WalletManager: Using mnemonic (length): 12
WalletManager: Saving encrypted wallet data with PIN
WalletManager: Wallet data encrypted and saved
WalletManager: Wallet unlocked
WalletManager: Basic wallet setup completed successfully
Setup response: {success: true}
Wallet setup successful, restoring interface
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Full Lightning Functionality**

### **Phase 1: Research Breez SDK Requirements**
1. Check Breez SDK documentation for API requirements
2. Determine if we need to register for API access
3. Find proper configuration examples

### **Phase 2: Implement Proper Breez SDK Integration**
1. Add API key configuration to settings
2. Implement proper Breez SDK initialization
3. Add connection retry logic and error handling

### **Phase 3: Alternative Solutions**
If Breez SDK requires complex setup:
1. Consider other Lightning libraries (LDK, LND REST)
2. Implement LNURL-only mode (no built-in wallet)
3. Focus on QR code generation for external wallets

## üéØ **Current Goal: Verify Basic Functionality**

Let's first confirm the basic wallet setup works without Breez SDK. This will prove:
- ‚úÖ Extension architecture is sound
- ‚úÖ Storage and encryption work
- ‚úÖ UI flows are correct
- ‚úÖ Tip detection works
- ‚úÖ QR code generation works

Then we can tackle the Breez SDK integration as a separate challenge.

**Try the updated extension now and let me know if the basic wallet setup completes successfully!** üîß
